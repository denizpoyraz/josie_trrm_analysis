make_df:
    codes to read josie data, and also does convolution(trc). naming of the codes explains for which purpose and year the code is for
    To merge data-sets for example make one df from 2009 and 2010 data, you need to use merge_df.py
    For these codes, there are some booleans or years that need to be changed
    bool_sm_hv: for HV smoothing, for almost all the codes this is set to True
    bool_0910_decay: if the initial value of islow will be the decayed one from the preparation data, this also
    True for all 0910 data

analysis:
    calculate_beta_eachsim: as name suggests, each beta for each simulation is calculated (slow stoichmetry factor)
    calculate_finalbeta: calculates the median of all betas for specific sonde solution category
    fit_fast_time_response: fitting tfast, but the code isn't working when tried it now
    obtain_and_apply_calibration.py:
        does the fitting for calculation calibration functions.
        write_to_df should set to True for reprocessing

functions: some functions used in the codes.
    data_cuts is an important one to see which simulations are used foe the analysis

latex: latex files to make the final plots for the paper, not well organized

plotting:
    adif_rdif_plots:
        makes the ADif, RDif plots that are in the supplementarty material
        https://github.com/denizpoyraz/josie_trrm_analysis/blob/a258000d35e998ea70e6f4901ca0b1e723db7ccd/codes/plotting/adif_rdif_plots.py#L14-L17
        you need to change year tags for the year you want to plots
        bool_inter is set to True to interpolate time response test period in 0910 data
    beta_box_plot: as name says
        if you want to make the version without ib0 subtraction, use commented out df
        # df1 = pd.read_csv("/home/poyraden/Analysis/JOSIEfiles/Proccessed/Josie0910_Data_nocut_beta_paper_noib0.csv")
    plot_averaged_profiles: plots conventional, trc, trcc, opm profiles and also calculates TO values.
        if you want to plot other sonde/sol types change https://github.com/denizpoyraz/josie_trrm_analysis/blob/a258000d35e998ea70e6f4901ca0b1e723db7ccd/codes/plotting/plot_averaged_profiles.py#L210
        the listing is
        https://github.com/denizpoyraz/josie_trrm_analysis/blob/a258000d35e998ea70e6f4901ca0b1e723db7ccd/constant_variables.py#L122
        this is slist = [0, 1, 3, 4] for 0910 and 9602 and [0, 2, 4, 5] for 2017
    plot_beta_scan: as name suggests
        use bool_noib0 = True if you want to use noibo_subtraction version fo the data
        also need to change https://github.com/denizpoyraz/josie_trrm_analysis/blob/a258000d35e998ea70e6f4901ca0b1e723db7ccd/codes/plotting/plot_beta_scan.py#L13-L16
        for each different year

    plot_final_plots: this makes the scatter plots in RDif and ADif for different years
        one needs to pay attention to years etc...
